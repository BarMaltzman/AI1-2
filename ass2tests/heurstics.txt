We choose the following heuristics:
1. for the zero sum game, calculate the distance of both player from goal
   if current player's distance is higher than other player's return -1,
   if they're equal return 0 otherwise 1.

2. for the semi coop game, calculate the distance of both player from goal
   and return a vector of both distances.
3. for the semi coop game, calculate the distance of both player from goal
   and return the sum of both distances.
